1) What is curvature .....mp4 is  simplest explination, and i think it
   applies to  our application  for determining  the curvature  of the
   deviated path of  the robot from the ideal curvature  to get to the
   goal point.  By 1.05min a good definition is gained for the circle,
   our case, the rest is for more complex cases.

2) Arc Length....mp4, goto 5:40min for good definition, the rest is a
   mathamatical deravation.


1) Curvature  is inversely porportional  to the radius of  the circle.
   Smaller curves bend more sharply and hence have higher curvature.

2) Curvature is a measure of how curvy a curve is, the tighter the curve,
   that  is  the  smaller  the  radius of  the  curve,  the  greater  the
   curvature.
