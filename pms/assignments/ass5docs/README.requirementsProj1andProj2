After reading Yamauchi and the project specs and hints given by Alen:

LRF = Laser Range Finder
FT = Frontier Node or Cell
UK = Unkown Node or Cell
FS = Free Space or Cell
BFS = Breath First Search
DFS = Depth First Search
A* = A Star


Project2:
--------

Given an Occupancy  Grid or Evidence Grid generated by  a LRF or Stage
program in our case, use FT exploration to map your environment.

So use FT exploration, moving from one  FT to the next FT, to create a
map of  your environment, thus  mapping all  the FS cells  within your
environment.  This map  is then used for  subsequent navigation within
your environment.

Movement from one FT to the next is done by rotation the robot at it's
current location and  using the LRF readings to  determine the closest
FT node.   The LRF angles are  0 degrees, 90 degrees,  180 degrees and
360  degrees.  The  robot  moves  to the  closest  FT  to its  current
location.

Once the  environment has been fully  mapped, and given a  robot start
and goal  location a path planner  like BFS, DFS or  A* algorithims is
used  to navigate  the  robot from  start to  goal  locations via  the
shortest obstacle free path, defined by a series of waypoints.

OR
Are the BFS, DFS, A* used to navigate from FT to next FT also?

Moving the robot from waypoint to  waypoint is done via a pure persuit
method.  This entails  using robot velocity and turn  rate to navigate
to the  waypoints while  along the  way we readjust  the angle  of the
robot so that it is still on  track to the waypoint.  This is done due
to the robot angle wobbling as it moves to the next waypoint.


Project2:
--------

OgMap from Stage program and updated  by Project1 every 10 seconds, is
used to develop  a PRM(don't really know what this  is???)  A BFS, DFS
or A* algorithim is used to determine the shortest obsticale free path
to goal location of the robot  from its current location. This path is
then passed to Project1???


Need to verify this with Alen.

Also,  see  13jun2017  in  notes  to  help  clarify  proj1  and  proj2
specification.
