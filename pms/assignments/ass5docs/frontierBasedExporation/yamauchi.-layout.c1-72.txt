We introduce a new approach f o r exploration based on the            wh
concept of frontiers, regions on the boundaly between                   
open space and unexplored space. By moving to new fron-               te
tiers, a mobile robot can extend its map into new territory           bu
until the entire environment has been explored. We                    as
describe a method f o r detecting frontiers in evidence grids         en
and navigating to these frontiers. We also introduce a                [6
technique f o r minimizing specular rejections in evidence            an
grids using laser-limited sonar: We have tested this                  th
approach with a real mobile robot, exploring real-world               re
oSJice environments cluttered with a variety of obstacles.              
An advantage of our approach is its ability to explore both           co
large open spaces and narrow cluttered spaces, with walls             in
and obstacles in arbitrary orientations.                              re

     While many robots can navigate using maps, few can               ro
build their own maps. Usually a human must map the ter-               li
ritory in advance, providing either the exact locations of            sp
obstacles (for metric maps) or a graph representing the
connectivity between open regions (for topological maps).             2.
As a result, most mobile robots become unable to navigate
efficiently when placed in unknown environments.                        
     Exploration has the potential to free robots from this           kn
limitation. We define exploration to be the act of moving             mu
through an unknown environment while building a map                   no
that can be used for subsequent navigation. A good explo-             in
ration strategy is one that generates a complete or nearly            wo
complete map in a reasonable amount of time.                          qu
     Considerable work has been done in simulated explo-                
ration, but these simulations often view the world as a set           To
of floorplans. The blueprint view of a typical office build-          th
ing presents a structure that seems simple and straightfor-             
ward-rectangular      offices, square conference rooms,               sp
straight hallways, and right angles everywhere-but the

frontier, it can see into unexplored space and add the new             
information to its map. As a result, the mapped territory               
expands, pushing back the boundary between the known                    
and the unknown. By moving to successive frontiers, the                 
robot can constantly increase its knowledge of the world.               
We call this strategy frontier-based exploration.                       
     If a robot with a perfect map could navigate to a par-             
ticular point in space, that point is considered accessible.            
All accessible space is contiguous, since a path must exist             
from the robot’s initial position to every accessible point.          
Every such path will be at least partially in mapped terri-             
tory, since the space around the robot’s initial location is          
mapped at the start. Every path that is partially in                    
unknown territory will cross a frontier. When ihe robot                 
navigates to that frontier, it will incorporate more of the             
space covered by the path into mapped territory. If thc                 
robot does not incorporate the entire path at one time, then            
a new frontier will always exist further along the path, sep-           
arating the known and unknown segments and providing a                  
new destination for exploration.                                        
     In this way, a robot using frontier-based exploration              
will eventually explore all of the accessible space in the              
world-assuming perfect sensors and perfect motor con-                   
trol. A Zcno-like Paradox where the new information con-                
tributed by each new frontier decreases geometrically is                
theoretically possible (though highly unlikely), but even in            
such a case, the map will become arbitrary accurate in a                
finite amount of time.                                                  
     The real question is how well frontier-based explora-              
tion will work using the noisy sensors and imperfect motor
control of a real robot in the real world. This is the ques-            
tion that this research is intended to address.
                                                                        
2.1 Laser-Limited Sonar                                                 
                                                                        
     We use evidence grids 171 as our spatial representa-               
tion. Evidence grids are Cartesian grids containing cells,              
and each cell stores the probability that the corresponding             
region in space is occupied. Initially all of the cells are set         
to the prior probability of occupancy, which is a rough
estimate of the overall probability that any given location             
will be occupied. Each time a sensor reading is obtained                
from the robot’s sonar, infrared, or laser rangefinders, the          
corresponding sensor model is uscd to update the grid.
     The main problem with sonar sensors is that instead
                                                                        
of bouncing back toward the sensor, the sound pulse can
                                                                        
hit a flat surface and bounce away from the sensor. Then
                                                                        
either the sonar senses nothing, or it senses objects that,
                                                                        
like reflections in a mirror, appear to be much farther away
                                                                        
than the nearest surface.
                                                                        
     These reflections could cause difficulties for frontier-
                                                                        
based exploration, not only due to inaccuracies in the map,
but also because specular reflections oftcn appear as large

                              Figure 1: Frontier detection: (a) evidence

     Figure l a shows an evidence grid built by a real robot            
in a hallway adjacent to two open doors. Figure l b shows               
the frontier edge segments detected in the grid. Figure IC              
shows the regions that are larger than the minimum fron-                
tier size. The centroid of each region is marked by                     
crosshairs. Frontier 0 and frontier 1 correspond to open                
doorways, while frontier 2 is the unexplored hallway.                   
                                                                        
2.3 Navigating to Frontiers                                             
                                                                        
     Once frontiers have been detected within a particular              
evidence grid, the robot attempts to navigate to the nearest            
accessible, unvisited frontier. The path planner uses a                 
depth-first search on the grid, starting at the robot's current         
cell and attempting to take the shortest obstacle-free path
to the cell containing the goal location.                               
     While the robot moves toward its destination, reactive
obstacle avoidance behaviors prevent collisions with any                
obstacles not present while the evidence grid was con-                  
structed. In a dynamic environment, this is necessary to                
avoid collisions with, for example, people who are walk-                
ing about. These behaviors allow the robot to steer around              
these obstacles and, as long as the world has not changed               
too drastically, return to follow its path to the destination.

by white space; cells with unknown occupancy probability
are represented by small dots; and cells with high occu-
pancy probability are represented by large dots. The
robot’s position is represented by the black circle with a
line marking the robot’s orientation. The robot’s path is
indicated by the black line.
     In Figure 2a, the robot starts in the center of the hall-
way, builds an evidence grid using laser-limited sonar, and
detects three frontiers. The robot navigates to the closest
frontier, Frontier 1. In Figure 2b, the robot has arrived at
its destination and added the observations from its new
location to the evidence grid. The robot detects two fron-
tiers and navigates to the closest, Frontier 0. This frontier
corresponds to an open doorway leading to an unexplored
office. (Frontiers are numbered based on the current grid,
so Frontier 2 in Figure 2a is the same as Frontier 1 in
Figure 2b.) In Figure 2c, the robot has moved through the
doorway, detecting a new frontier in the center of the room
at the boundary of its usable sonar range (ten feet).
     Figure 2d shows the robot after it has explored more
of the office. The robot detects five frontiers in this grid,
and it navigates to the closest, Frontier 2. In Figure 2e, the
robot detect six frontiers, but the two closest frontiers are           
inaccessible. Frontier 1 is between a chair and a desk, and             
Frontier 2 is a narrow gap between two desks. In both
cases, there is insufficient clearance to allow the robot to           4
navigate to the frontier, so the robot navigates to the near-
                                                                        
est accessible frontier, Frontier 0.
     In Figure 2f, the robot has completed its exploration             b
of the office. The total time required was about half an               s
hour. An improved version of this system can map the                   w
same office in about fifteen minutes.                                  H
      The two remaining frontiers are the result of specular           b

detect using the laser (from certain angles). Frontier 0 cor-          r

responds to a black filing cabinet, and Frontier 1 corre-
sponds to a gray bookshelf. The robot’s path planner                  
determines that both of these frontiers are inaccessible, so           m
                                                                       e
it plans a path to Frontier 2 in the hallway. The robot then
follows this path out of the office to further explore the              
building.                                                              r

constructed during this exploration. The lab area, at the              s
top of the image, contains large open spaces as well as
                                                                       s

Although the total area is larger (45 feet x 25 feet), the             i
robot was able to map the open spaces quickly, mapping                  
the entire environment in about half an hour.                          H

environment consisting of a three corridors constructed

     Thrun and Bucken [9] have developed an exploration               us
system that builds a spatial representation that combines
evidence grids with a topological map. This system has                  
been able to explore the network of hallways within a
large building. While this approach works well within the               
hallway domain, it assumes that all walls are either paral-             
lel or perpendicular to each other, and that they do not                
deviate more than 15 degrees from these orientations. An                
implicit assumption is that walls are observable and not                
obstructed by obstacles. These assumptions make this                    
approach unsuitable for rooms cluttered with obstacles                  
that may be in arbitrary orientations.                                  
     A robot using frontier-based exploration has three                 
advantages over the systems described above. First, it can              
explore environments containing both open and cluttered                 
spaces. Second, it can explore environments where walls                 
and obstacles are in arbitrary orientations. Third, it can              
explore efficiently by moving to the locations that are most            
likely to add new information to the map.                               
                                                                        
5.0 Conclusions and Future Work                                         
                                                                        
     In this paper, we have introduced a new approach to                
exploration based on the concept of frontiers, regions on               
the boundary between open space and unexplored space.                   
By constantly moving to new frontiers, a mobile robot can               
extend its map into new territory until the entire environ-             
ment has been explored. We have described and imple-                    
mented a method for detecting frontiers in evidence grids               
and navigating autonomously to these frontiers. We have                 
also introduced a technique for minimizing specular                     
reflections in evidence grids using laser-limited sonar. We             
have tested this approach with a real mobile robot, by                  
exploring two different real-world office environments                  
cluttered with a variety of obstacles.                                  
     We have recently integrated frontier-based explora-                
tion with the continuous localization techniques developed              
by Schultz, Adams, and Grefenstette [8]. The integrated                 
system is designed to explore large environments while                  
maintaining an accurate position estimate. Initial results              
have been very promising, and we are currently conduct-                 
ing experiments to test the performance of the integrated               
system.
