     In Figure 2a, the robot starts in the center of the hall-
way, builds an evidence grid using laser-limited sonar, and
detects three frontiers. The robot navigates to the closest
frontier, Frontier 1. In Figure 2b, the robot has arrived at
its destination and added the observations from its new
location to the evidence grid. The robot detects two fron-
tiers and navigates to the closest, Frontier 0. This frontier
corresponds to an open doorway leading to an unexplored
office. (Frontiers are numbered based on the current grid,
so Frontier 2 in Figure 2a is the same as Frontier 1 in
Figure 2b.) In Figure 2c, the robot has moved through the
doorway, detecting a new frontier in the center of the room
at the boundary of its usable sonar range (ten feet).
     Figure 2d shows the robot after it has explored more
of the office. The robot detects five frontiers in this grid,
and it navigates to the closest, Frontier 2. In Figure 2e, the
robot detect six frontiers, but the two closest frontiers are               Figure 3: Evidence grid from frontier-based
