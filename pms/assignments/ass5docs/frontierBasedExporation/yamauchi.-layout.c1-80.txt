     Figure l a shows an evidence grid built by a real robot                    
in a hallway adjacent to two open doors. Figure l b shows                       
the frontier edge segments detected in the grid. Figure IC                      
shows the regions that are larger than the minimum fron-                        
tier size. The centroid of each region is marked by                             
crosshairs. Frontier 0 and frontier 1 correspond to open                        
doorways, while frontier 2 is the unexplored hallway.                           
                                                                                
2.3 Navigating to Frontiers                                                     
                                                                                
     Once frontiers have been detected within a particular                      
evidence grid, the robot attempts to navigate to the nearest                    
accessible, unvisited frontier. The path planner uses a                         
depth-first search on the grid, starting at the robot's current                 
cell and attempting to take the shortest obstacle-free path
to the cell containing the goal location.                                       
     While the robot moves toward its destination, reactive
obstacle avoidance behaviors prevent collisions with any                        
obstacles not present while the evidence grid was con-                          
structed. In a dynamic environment, this is necessary to                        
avoid collisions with, for example, people who are walk-                        
ing about. These behaviors allow the robot to steer around                      
these obstacles and, as long as the world has not changed                       
too drastically, return to follow its path to the destination.

are represented by small dots; and cells with high occu-

robot’s position is represented by the black circle with a
line marking the robot’s orientation. The robot’s path is
indicated by the black line.
     In Figure 2a, the robot starts in the center of the hall-
way, builds an evidence grid using laser-limited sonar, and
detects three frontiers. The robot navigates to the closest
frontier, Frontier 1. In Figure 2b, the robot has arrived at
its destination and added the observations from its new
location to the evidence grid. The robot detects two fron-
tiers and navigates to the closest, Frontier 0. This frontier
corresponds to an open doorway leading to an unexplored
office. (Frontiers are numbered based on the current grid,
so Frontier 2 in Figure 2a is the same as Frontier 1 in
Figure 2b.) In Figure 2c, the robot has moved through the
doorway, detecting a new frontier in the center of the room
at the boundary of its usable sonar range (ten feet).
     Figure 2d shows the robot after it has explored more
of the office. The robot detects five frontiers in this grid,
and it navigates to the closest, Frontier 2. In Figure 2e, the
robot detect six frontiers, but the two closest frontiers are               Figu
inaccessible. Frontier 1 is between a chair and a desk, and                     
Frontier 2 is a narrow gap between two desks. In both
cases, there is insufficient clearance to allow the robot to           4.0 Relat
navigate to the frontier, so the robot navigates to the near-
                                                                            Cons
est accessible frontier, Frontier 0.
     In Figure 2f, the robot has completed its exploration             building,
of the office. The total time required was about half an               simulatio
hour. An improved version of this system can map the                   world as 
same office in about fifteen minutes.                                  However, 
      The two remaining frontiers are the result of specular           been impl

     A robot using frontier-based exploration has three                    Robot
advantages over the systems described above. First, it can                 Navig
explore environments containing both open and cluttered                    and C
spaces. Second, it can explore environments where walls                    Michi
and obstacles are in arbitrary orientations. Third, it can                 Benja
explore efficiently by moving to the locations that are most               explo
likely to add new information to the map.                                  seman
