sensor_msgs::ImagePtr msg
	=  cv_bridge::CvImage(std_msgs::Header(), enc::MONO8,cvPtr_->image).toImageMsg();

image_pub_.publish(msg);

in seperateThread()

Publishes the current ogMap image, that  we have just updated with the
current FT,  UK, FS,  O, determined from  the current  robot position.
The updated ogMap image is also displayed in the "view" window.

(it is inserted where test for  changing ogMap image values is located
at this stage)

So the view window contains the latest/updated ogMap image and we need
to Send it to the map_to_image_node  so it reflex's the latest updated
ogMap image.  I think this is done by

// Subscribe to the topic that generates the updated ogMap image.
image_sub_ 
= it_.subscribe("image_image/full", 1 ,&map_to_image_node::&map_to_image_node, this);

now rqt_view_image  should display  the updated  ogMap image  that the
"view" displays, as it should.
