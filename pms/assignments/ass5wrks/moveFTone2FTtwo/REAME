detectFrontiers.request_goal.fork/

includes the detectFrontiers(), algorithim may still be incorrect:

nedd to test for: !FS !0 and !FT foreach, cell above, cell below, cell
left, cell right, before the following line.

if ((image.at<uchar>(y, x)!=FS) && (image.at<uchar>(y, x)!=O)){



includes request_goal code that needs to be fixed and debugged, I
think it needs,

touch RequestGoal.cpp when a change to RequestGoal.h is made, to inact
changes of RequestGoal.h
