If you grep output.sample for the xg or yg you will see that none of
the values exceed the 20mx20m size of the ogMap.  FT cells are found
within the ogMap so this is the correct result.

Note when ( + (globalImageSize/2) is added to xg or yg this adds an
offset of [500,500] so the values should all be withing [520, 480]
