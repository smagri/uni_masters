details to the classes and operators.


Is using STL you can used cout/cin according to Bill@lynda.com.



Specialsation, code generated by the compiler for a template of a
particular type.

Used heavily in STL, the standard template library.


Code grows rapidly, to create each instance of each type for the

Templates result in longer compile time.

Used in containers.

Simple to implement and support.
