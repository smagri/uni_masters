Tempates are type acnostic classes.

Specialsation, code generated by the compiler for a template of a
particular type.

Used heavily in STL, the standard template library.


Code grows rapidly, to create each instance of each type for the
template.

Compiler gives confusing error messages, so debugging can ber
challenging.

Templates result in longer compile time.

Used in containers.

Simple to implement and support.
