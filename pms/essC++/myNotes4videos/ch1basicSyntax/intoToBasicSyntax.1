- This chapter is about the basic syntax of the C++ language. The idea
is to have you dive in to the language with some real code right
away. By necessity, this means we'll use language features that will
be explained later, either in this chapter or in later chapters. Don't
let this get in your way. Go ahead and dive in and follow the
exercises. If something isn't immediately obvious to you, that's
okay. Just keep going or you may stop and experiment with what you
don't understand.

The basic syntax of C++ is very simple. A statement is a union of code
terminated by a semicolon. Statements are used for a variety of
purposes; to call functions, declare and initialize variables, or to
operate on expressions. A function is a larger unit of code that may
contain many statements or expressions. A function is designed to be
re-used or to be called by another statement. The main function is the
main entry point of any C++ program.

Main is called by the operating system when your program first
launches. A variable holds values for later use in other statements
and expressions. In C++, variables must be declared before they're
used. The variable may then be used to provide its value to statements
and expressions later in your code. In the rest of this chapter, we'll
go through the basic syntax of C++ in a lot more detail. You'll learn
how to construct a syntactically correct program, how to define
variables, use pointers and references, and how to use conditional
expressions and loops.

Take your time. Experiment with the exercise files and be sure to go
through the whole chapter. Understanding these fundamental concepts
will help you get the most out of the rest of this course.
