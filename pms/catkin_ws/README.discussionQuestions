project2: robot navigation to frontier:

Just to be  clear, and for keeping  in mind while coding,  We start by
navigating the robot from the centre of the ogMap to a frontier on the
ogmap, that is the robot doesn't start at a frontier.﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿?

And if we do this the robot doesn't get stuck anywhere?
