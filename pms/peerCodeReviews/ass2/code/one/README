laser.h
getAngularResolution() missing.

radar.h
no need getSampleSize()

sonar.h
getSampleSize() not necessary

laser.cpp, radar.cpp, sonar.cpp should inherit default variables from
ranger class constructor.


ranger.h
protected:
Ranger(model, rangeMax, rangeMin) not there

virtual method incorrect fn and need to be made pure virtual for an
abstract class.


ranger.cpp:
sanity/valid check for baud, port ...etc not there, report sane values not
there

DOCUMENTATION: is very minimal except for appropriate variable naming

LOOK: set to 80 character width as makes code hard to read


rangerfusion.cpp
hard coded value for fusion algorithim


main.cpp
serial ports all at ACM0 by default???
