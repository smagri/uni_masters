laser.h
-apart from set/getAngularResolution() other methods don't need to be there
-same with private variables
-they belong in ranger class

radar.h
-same as for laser.h wrt private vars

sonar.h
-same as for laser.h wrt private vars

laser.cpp, radar.cpp, sonar.cpp:
-should inherit default variables from
ranger class constructor.
-random number generation/range calculations should be in ranger class

ranger.h
-protected: needed not private: member data
Ranger(model, rangeMax, rangeMin) not there

-probably overuse of virtual and getDist() not pure virtual with =0
-virtual method incorrect fn and need to be made pure virtual for an
abstract class.


ranger.cpp:
sanity/valid check for baud, port ...etc not there, report sane values not
there

DOCUMENTATION: none


rangerfusion.cpp
-hard coded value for fusion algorithim, algorithim suspect and incomplete


main.cpp
-no print functions in laser.cpp, radar.cpp and sonar.cpp
