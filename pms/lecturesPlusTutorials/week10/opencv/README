histogram & displayImage
------------------------

Are    template    programs    that    are    incororated    in    the
ROS Nodes/Topics example:

~/uni/sub/proj30cp/randomNum_node/

and later parts of it in:

~/uni/sub/proj30cp/rosopencv_node & ~/uni/subj/proj30cp/rosocv_node.

Where rosopencv_node  has the more  modern node creation  methods, and
rosocv_node has the old  style.  Old style seems to be  used by Alen in
class examples.  Both are examples of  a combined ROS and OpenCV node.



histogram: 

With an  image as input produces  a histogram of number  of pixels the
image has  at the  intensities 0 to  255, where intensity  black=0 and
intensity white=255.

run as:

cd /lu1/smagri/uni/subj/pms/lecturesPlusTutorials/week10/opencv/histogram

buid/histogram images/parkesLunar.jpg



displayImage:

displayImage.cpp  is  incorporated  into  histogram.cpp and  does  the
loading  of the  image,  from  the command  line,  converting it  into
greyscale and displays the image in a window.
