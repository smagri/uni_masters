Polymorphism:

Occurs when classes inherit other classes.

Fn executed depends on the type of object that invokes it.

Qs:

What does a single value mean, hint, could we assume a square?

What might be  the pitfall of this class, and  is this bad programming
practice?



Inheritance:

c++ classes that inherit from the base classes.

This involves a base class and a derived class.

Derived class inherits  the member of the base class,  on top of which
it can add its own members.

Qs:

Why is this so?


Inheritance, Base Class, class Shape.

class Rectangle: public Shape{}

Triangle?
Can you allow specifying side + height; ie three sides?

Circle?


Inheritance, What is inherited for the base class?

A _publicly_ derived  class inherits every member(fn  and data?)of the
base class except:

* its constructors and its destructor
* its assignment operator memberd(operator=)
* its friends
* *** its private members


'Pure Virtual' member functions?

A member  fn declaration that  turns a  normal class into  an abstract
class.
Is only implemented in a derived class.

class Shape{
...
virtual void draw() const = 0; // = 0 means it is 'pure virtual'.
