Current build/ is equivalent to triangle.shapePtr/.
triangle.shapePtr/ works and  triangle.final.wrks/ works also.  They
are the same but triangle.shapePtr adds the use of pointer to access the
objects.  triangle.shapePtr/ is the true final code for the week3
tutorial exercises.  The files here are the same as in:
pms/lecturesPlusTutorials/week3/proj/tutorial
parent directory.


wrks/ contains the various major milestones of creating the final
triangle executable code.
