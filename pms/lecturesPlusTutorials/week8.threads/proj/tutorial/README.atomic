Type atomic can be applied to  any simple type, like int float bool...
When used on a varible access  to that variable is atomic.  Also note,
in atomic/main.cpp cout  is !locked, thus delta var is  atomic but the
output to the screen is not.

noAtomicOrMutex:
* cout is !locked again so output to screen is not atomic
* delta var is !atomic so you get eg:
var val is 2299
var val is 2299
var val is 2299
var val is 2300 - we have phantom var++ here
