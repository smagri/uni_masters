This occurs due to renaming the parent directory(wrt build dir) after a,
     cd build; cmake../; make,
has ocurred on the old parent directory(wrt build dir) name.

ing_condition_vars.manual.cmake.make/build%cmake ../
CMake Error: The current CMakeCache.txt directory
/lu1/smagri/uni/subj/pms/lecturesPlusTutorials/week8/proj/tutorial.inClass/using_condition_vars.manual.cmake.make/build/CMakeCache.txt
is different than the directory
/lu1/smagri/uni/subj/pms/lecturesPlusTutorials/week8/proj/tutorial.inClass/using_condition_vars/build
where CMakeCache.txt was created. This may result in binaries being
created in the wrong place. If you are not sure, reedit the
CMakeCache.txt
CMake Error: The source
"/lu1/smagri/uni/subj/pms/lecturesPlusTutorials/week8/proj/tutorial.inClass/using_condition_vars.manual.cmake.make/CMakeLists.txt"
does not match the source
"/lu1/smagri/uni/subj/pms/lecturesPlusTutorials/week8/proj/tutorial.inClass/using_condition_vars/CMakeLists.txt"
used to generate cache.  Re-run cmake with a different source
directory.


To Fix:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Remove everything in the build directory:

smagri@gyan1:/lu1/smagri/uni/subj/pms/lecturesPlusTutorials/week8/proj/tutorial.inClass/using_condition_vars.manual.cmake.make/build%rm -rf *


As usual now do:
cmake ../
make
