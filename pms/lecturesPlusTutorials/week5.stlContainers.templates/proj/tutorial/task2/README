Using  the STL for the Rectangle, Triangle, Circle Classes(from Shape
Base Class).

Instead of using an array, can we use a vector?

I think this question requires to implemnent vector version and see
the result???

vector<Shape *ptr2shape> = {&r1, &r2, &r3, &c1, &c2, &c3};

vector<int>::iterator itbegin = vi1.begin();
vector<int>::iterator itend = vi1.end();

for (it=itbegin; it<itend; it++){
 // this prints out the contents of the it pointer, which is a pointer
 // to a Shape.
 cout << *it << ' ';
}


In shapefuncions.cpp:

...num_shapes = vi1.size() ???
vi1.at(i)->pointIsInShape(x,y)
total_area += vi1.at(i)->area()

note: vi1[5] == vi1.at(5)

using range based for loop for -
for (Shape &i; vi1){
cout << i << ' ';
