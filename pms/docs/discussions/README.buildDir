Delete your build directory .. you only need to carry your source code
across to  different PC, this  is why we  advocate for "out  of source
builds", you can simply delete the build directory and all your source
files are intact.

Create a  new build directory and  then use QTCreator to  compile your
code again.

Or on command line
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
